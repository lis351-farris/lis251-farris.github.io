    <h2>a list of all my professional interests!</h2>
    <p>
        I'd like to think of myself as a very flexible individual and I'd also like to think that my interests reflect
        that. <br>

        My interests include:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>UI/UX Design</li>
        <li>Game Design</li>
        <li>Artificial Intelligence</li>

    </ul> <br>

    <p>
        UI/UX Design is the design of the User Interface or User eXperience. For example a website with good UI/UX is
        Google's search engine, it is simple to use and has all the necessary information at first glance. UI/UX Design
        has developed from being an overlooked field to becoming one of the most important parts of product design!
        <br> Here is an image that quickly explains the design process:

        Growing up I spent most of my time playing video games and discovering worlds created by other people.
        Therefore, I entered the field of Computer Science in hopes that I can provide the same experience to the people
        of the future. <br> <br>

        Last but not least, I'd like to talk about Artificial Intelligence, or AI for short, is an umbrella term
        encompassing all human creations that can learn and give feedback like a pseudo-human. The main way of teaching
        AI, is by using Machine Learning, I am actually taking a class on machine learning and would like to use a
        screenshot of one of our slides to show you an example! <br>
