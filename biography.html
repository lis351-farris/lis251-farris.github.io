    <h2>This is a quick run down of who I am and where I come from</h2>

    <p>I was born in a beautiful country in the middle of the desert named Saudi Arabia, specifically the capital
        Riyadh.<br></p>

        I was born in the summer of 2002, (fun fact! I was born with a green birth mark on my back!) <br>
        I am a Junior majoring in Computer Science here at UW-Madison. I am also sponsored by the KAUST Gifted Student Program <br>
