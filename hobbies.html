    <h2>a list of all my hobbies!</h2>

    <p>
        I am always trying new things which gives me the privilege of having a couple of different things I like to do
        in my free time! <br>
        My hobbies include:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Table Tennis</li>
        <li>Video Games</li>
        <li>Cars</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Table Tennis or Ping Pong, is a sport that I never really took seriously or even considered a sport, until I
        joined the table tennis club here at UW! The people that attend all love and appreciate the inner workings of
        the sport which proved to me that it's more than just a game to play. <br> <br>

        Video games are not just a hobby for me, they're a passion a lot of my childhood has been spent playing them, a
        lot of people have an unfortunate misconception about them, which is that they are just a waste of time. In my
        opinion, that cannot be further from the truth, as I've learned a lot of history from them, they helped me
        garner problem solving skills by solving puzzles and they have allowed me to practice my creativity freely! <br>

        Here's picture of me testing out a level in Super Mario Maker 2:

        Cars are beautiful machines that are not only to take you from point A to B, they are works of art that need to
        be appreciated. My dream is to have a car garage that I can work on and modify cars to my heart's content. <br>
        Here are pictures I took of cars I found in LA:

        "<i> It's what non-car people don't get. They see all cars as just a ton and a half, two tons of wires, glass, metal,
            and rubber, and that's all they see. People like you or I know we have an unshakable belief that cars are living
            entities… You can develop a relationship with a car and that's what non-car people don't get… When something has
            foibles and won't handle properly, that gives it a particularly human quality because it makes mistakes, and
            that's how you can build a relationship with a car that other people won't get.</i>" <br>
